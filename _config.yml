    My name is Vangelis and I am a seasoned computer science person (I am not really fond of the term "IT"). I have done research in wireless mobile systems (3G, 4G, 5G) and published in top peer-reviewed magazines and journals on the topic of systemic design for adaptable communication systems (e.g. cognitive and adaptive networks). I have worked extensively on software engineering requirements for runtime-adaptable systems and I developed prototypes that enable (a) the dynamic discovery of the features available and achievable for a given system, and (b) the on-demand adaptation of its code during runtime to match a given set of features. Since 2010 I have been active on the <mark>Internet of Things</mark> domain, where I led projects in the areas of <mark>Smart Home</mark> and <mark>Smart Grid</mark>, <mark>Industrial Cyber Physical Systems</mark>, <mark>Big Data</mark>, and <mark>Data Analytics</mark>. Recently I have been focusing more intently on cybersecurity, where I contribute in a senior expert capacity to the assessment of research and development programmes, the development of pan-european best practice recommendations, and the advancement of technical standards, within projects under the auspices of the <mark>European Commission</mark>, the <mark>European Network and Information Security Agency</mark>, the <mark>European Telecommunications Standards Institute</mark>, and the <mark>GSM Association</mark>. In terms of thematic areas, I am most deeply familiar with <mark>Distributed Systems</mark>, <mark>Systems of Systems</mark>, <mark>System Design</mark>, <mark>3GPP Systems</mark>, <mark>Design Patterns</mark>, <mark>Ontologies</mark>, <mark>Discrete Event Simulation</mark>, <mark>UML</mark>, <mark>Matlab</mark>, and <mark>Java</mark>.

    When it comes to home projects one does for fun, I frequently use <mark>Bash</mark> and <mark>Ansible</mark>.

    And I love honey.

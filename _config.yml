    My name is Vangelis and I am, for the most part, a computer science person (I am not really fond of the term "IT"). I grew scientifically through research in wireless mobile systems (<mark>3G</mark>, <mark>4G</mark>, <mark>5G</mark>). I particularly focus on <mark>systems design</mark> for adaptable distributed systems (e.g. cognitive networks, autonomic networks, etc.). These concerns include <mark>design principles</mark> and <mark>design patterns</mark> through which one can develop systems capable of <mark>adaptation</mark> and <mark>agility</mark>.

    That research lead to extensive work on <mark>software engineering</mark> in support of <mark>adaptable systems</mark> that can dynamically alter their own behaviour. Key <mark>control aspects</mark> of such adaptable systems include algorithms that, given a corpus of capabilities, enable the <mark>dynamic discovery</mark> of features that meet application requirements. The <mark>dynamic assembly</mark> of a <mark>system's personality</mark> (i.e. set of behaviours) finds applications in a wide range of domains where requirements may change over time. The capacity to dynamically assemble a particular <mark>personality</mark> is a pillar of customization and <mark>operational agility</mark>. For instance, these algorithms enable the on-demand adaptation of a system's code during runtime to match a given set of features (e.g. when a protocol must undergo an update during runtime to accommodate a change in requirements or to incorporate a security patch).

    Since 2010 I have been active on the <mark>Internet of Things</mark> domain, where I led projects in the areas of <mark>Smart Home</mark> and <mark>Smart Grid</mark>, <mark>Industrial Cyber Physical Systems</mark>, <mark>Big Data</mark>, and <mark>Data Analytics</mark>.

    Recently I have been focusing more intently on <mark>cybersecurity</mark>, where I contribute in a senior leadership capacity. Among other activities, this involves the assessment of R&D programmes, the development <mark>best practice recommendations</mark> for ENISA, the advancement of <mark>technical standards</mark>, and joint work with strategic <mark>technology policy</mark> stakeholders. I am particularly interested in <mark>systemic approaches</mark> to <mark>resilience</mark> through the interplay of technological, policy and economic considerations. I advance these agendas as a member of these organizations:
    -   [European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA)](https://www.enisa.europa.eu/) Expert Group (EG) on IoT Security (<mark>IoTSec</mark>)
    -   European Commission (EC) [Directorate General (DG) Mobility and Transport (MOVE)](https://ec.europa.eu/transport/home_en) Expert Group (EG) on <mark>C-ITS PKI</mark>
    -   European Telecommunications Standards Institute (<mark>ETSI</mark>) [Technical Committee (TC) on Cybersecurity (CYBER)](https://www.etsi.org/committee/cyber)
    -   European Telecommunications Standards Institute (<mark>ETSI</mark>) [Industry Specification Group (ISG) on Securing Artificial Intelligence (SAI)](https://www.etsi.org/committee/sai)
    -   [GSM Association (GSMA)](https://www.gsma.com/)
        -   [Fraud and Security Architecture Group (FSAG)](https://www.gsma.com/aboutus/workinggroups/fraud-security-group)
        -   Device Security Group (DSG)
        -   IoT SAFE Group (IOTSAFE)
    -   [European Cyber Security Organization (ECSO)](https://ecs-org.eu/)
        -   [WG1 Cybersecurity Certification](https://ecs-org.eu/working-groups/wg1-standardisation-certification-and-supply-chain-management)
        -   [WG6 Strategic Research Agenda](https://ecs-org.eu/working-groups/wg6-sria-and-cyber-security-technologies)
    -   Joint Working Group (<mark>JWG</mark>) between <mark>CEN</mark>/<mark>CENELEC</mark> and <mark>ETSI</mark> for joint standardisation activities in cybersecurity for IoT

        -	Accountable for the end-to-end project integration and the final audit demonstration in project MOBIVAS.
        -	Accountable for network configuration and provisioning mechanisms to support the on-demand (i.e., over-the-air) delivery of value-added services in mobile networks in project MOBIVAS.
        -	Developed the architecture for the value-added service provision platform.
        -	Designed, developed and deployed the prototype for the network provisioning module supporting the dynamic change management of data traffic handling policies (i.e., QoS classification and treatment, charging and accounting classification) in an integrated manner to 3rd party service provider operations in the value-added service store (e.g., deployment of service, activation/deactivation of service, removal of service, etc.). The design of the prototype adopted the principles of policy-based networking in an SDN paradigm, where the user plane elements effecting the data traffic treatment (e.g., DiffServ routers) are logically separate (i.e., interface to each other over IP) from the control plane elements determining what the appropriate treatment is for each kind of traffic. Traffic identification and treatment leveraged deep packet inspection capacity of the DiffServ router and employed protocol header information from the network, transport and application layers.
        -	Designed, developed, tested and validated the prototype platform for the dynamic reconfiguration of the DiffServ classifier and the IP accounting modules in a router, jointly with NEC Europe R&D.
        -	Designed and developed an information model and OWL ontology for the dynamic assembly of protocol layers into complete protocol stacks in Software Definable Networking (Ph.D. thesis).
        -	Analyzed the computational complexity of optimized end-to-end transport level connectivity in multi-homing mobile devices (i.e., the “Always Best Connected” problem). Designed and developed a generic UML 2 model in Rational Rose RealTime to study (i.e., sensitivity analysis, etc.) the “Always Best Connected” problem formulated as a traffic engineering optimization problem.
        -	Designed, developed and evaluated a generic framework in Java for dynamic class loading, unloading and reloading of object code based on design patterns (e.g., chain of command for cascading class loaders) and meta-programming techniques (e.g., reflection).
        -	Developed and contributed to successful funding proposals under the EU Framework Program 5/6/7 (MOBIVAS (3.9M€), ANWIRE (1.2M€), GEANT2 (180.0 M€), E2R (15.9M€), SELF-NET (3.7M€)).
